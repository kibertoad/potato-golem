### Zone

Zone is a set of events and locations, that form a cohesive unit and exist in roughly same space.

Example of a zone would be a district.

### Location

Location is a particular place, that may require certain conditions in order to be discovered or entered, which provides its own set of choices.

An example of a location would be a bar or a shop.

Some locations may have sub-locations, e. g. you may enter the marketplace and then visit a particular merchant stand.

### Story

Story is a sequence of choices and consequences. Some of them only occur once, some are recurring. Some can be abandoned without making a choice, while others are unavoidable.

### Choice

Choice is a single action that a player takes. It typically has preconditions to be activated, and sometimes preconditions to even be displayed, and always have consequences (at least as minimal as advancing or concluding the story)
